Introduction
When working with multiple datasets or tables, combining them based on common columns or indices is a common operation. Pandas provides various methods to accomplish this task efficiently.

Methods Covered
1. pd.concat
Concatenates DataFrames along a particular axis.
2. Join Types
Left Join: Combines two DataFrames based on the keys from the left DataFrame.
Inner Join: Returns the intersection of keys present in both DataFrames.
Right Join: Combines two DataFrames based on the keys from the right DataFrame.
Outer Join: Returns the union of keys from both DataFrames.
Cross Join: Produces the Cartesian product of rows between two DataFrames.
Usage
Clone the repository to your local environment to explore and execute the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts.

bash
Copy code
SSH/HTML
cd pandas-joins
You'll need Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Use a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Jupyter Notebook or run the Python scripts to see examples of different DataFrame joining methods.

Examples
Explore the provided Jupyter Notebook (joins_examples.ipynb) to understand how to use each joining method. Examples demonstrate step-by-step procedures and include explanatory comments.

Visualizing Data
The repository includes an example of visualizing the joined data using a pie plot. This visual representation showcases the distribution of data after performing a join operation.

To visualize the data:

Execute the code in the Jupyter Notebook.
Navigate to the pie plot section.
Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to generate the pie plot based on the joined data.
